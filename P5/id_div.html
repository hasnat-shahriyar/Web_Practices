    <!-- Note : Div is not an inline element it is a block level element means the section will be in block. A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". -->

    <!-- Div-ID is an unique element so we don't use it often rather use it to define a section is unique or more important -->

    <!-- Div-Class can used many times as it is a common element -->

    <!-- So we can use Div-ID as the mother Section and Div-class as the children within an ID -->

            <p>This is Children 2 : Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <span>electronic typesetting</span>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
